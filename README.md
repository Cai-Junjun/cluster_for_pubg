Analysis the behaviour of players in PUBG solo top100 by kmeans cluster algorithm.
## Introduction
To be honest, i didnt't plan to put these code in GayHub at first. 
They are just a demo for my freshman mates. 
But some netizens of ZhiHu told me that they would like to see my sourse code in GayHub.
So that's it.
## Spider
The file [pubg.py](https://github.com/monlie/cluster_for_pubg/blob/master/pubg.py) includes a complete spider of [PUBG.ME](https://pubg.me/) and some i/o api for Excel.
## Clustering and Ploting
first_class.ipynb is my lecture note of *Introduction to Python*, the part of clustering and ploting is in somewhere middle of it.
It is not a typical python file, but you can run it by executing ```jupyter notebook``` in cmd or any other terminal.
## Other Files
[Timer.py](https://github.com/monlie/cluster_for_pubg/blob/master/timer.py) includes a decorator named ``rum_time`` which is used in first_class.ipynbï¼Œ but it is nothing do with our theme.
